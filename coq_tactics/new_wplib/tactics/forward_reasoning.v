    2.

(** * waterprove_with_hint
    First print an hint for reaching the target goal,
    try to prove the goal immediately afterward.

    Arguments:
        - [target_goal: constr], the goal to prove. 
        - [lemmas: constr], lemmas to pass to [waterprove] for automatically
            proving the [target_goal].

(** * By ... it holds that ... : ...
    Introduce a new sublemma and try to prove it immediately
    using a given lemma.

    Arguments:
        - [lemma: constr], reference to a lemma 
            used to prove the new sublemma (via [waterprove)]).
        - [id: ident], name for the new sublemma.
            If the proof succeeds, 
            it will become a hypotheses bearing [id] as name.
        - [conclusion: constr], the actual content 
            of the new sublemma to prove.
