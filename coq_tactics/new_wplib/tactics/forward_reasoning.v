(** * get_search_depth
    Placeholder for the function that retrieves the maximum
    search-depth to pass as an argument to [waterprove].
*)

    print (of_string "Warning: seach depth still hardcoded to '2'.");
    2.

(** * waterprove_with_hint
    First print an hint for reaching the target goal,
    try to prove the goal immediately afterward.

    Arguments:
        - [target_goal: constr], the goal to prove. 
        - [lemmas: constr], lemmas to pass to [waterprove] for automatically
            proving the [target_goal].
*)

Local Ltac2 print_failure () :=
    print (of_string "Waterproof could not find a proof. 
If you believe the statement should hold, 
try making a smaller step.").

(** * unwrap_optional_lemma
    Given an optional lemma, either returns the lemma itself,
    or case the argument is [None], returns a dummy lemma.

    Arguments:
        - [lemma: constr option], one of the following:
            - a [constr] referring to a lemma, wrapped in [Some].
            - the value [None]
    
    Returns:
        - [constr]: the provided lemma, or [dummy_lemma] in case
            the input was [None]. [dummy_lemma] simply states that [0=0].
*)
Local Ltac2 unwrap_optional_lemma (lemma: constr option) :=

    | None => constr:(dummy_lemma)
    | Some y => y
    end.

(** * By ... it holds that ... : ...
    Introduce a new sublemma and try to prove it immediately,
    optionally using a given lemma.

    Arguments:
        - [id: ident], name for the new sublemma.
            If the proof succeeds, 
            it will become a hypotheses bearing [id] as name.
        - [conclusion: constr], the actual content 
            of the new sublemma to prove.
        - [proving_lemma: constr], optional reference to a lemma 
            used to prove the new sublemma (via [waterprove)]).

    Introduce a new sublemma and try to prove it immediately
    using a given lemma.

    Arguments:

            used to prove the new sublemma (via [waterprove)]).
        - [id: ident], name for the new sublemma.
            If the proof succeeds, 
            it will become a hypotheses bearing [id] as name.

(** * It holds that ... : ...
    Introduce a new sublemma and try to prove it immediately.
    Same as [By ... it holds that ... : ...],
    but without using a specified lemma.

    Arguments:
        - [id: ident], name for the new sublemma.
            If the proof succeeds, 
            it will become a hypotheses bearing [id] as name.

            of the new sublemma to prove.
