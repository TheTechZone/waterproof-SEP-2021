(*
    Instantiate a variable in an exists goal, according to a given constructor, and also rename the constructor.

    Arguments:
        * s: ident, an ident for naming an indefined constr/variable.
        * t: constr, the requirted constr that needs to be instantiated.

    Does:
        * instantiates the constr t under the name s.

    Raises Exceptions:

(*
    Instantiate a variable in an exists goal, according to a given constructor, without renaming the constructor.

    Arguments:
        * t: constr, the requirted constr that needs to be instantiated.

    Does:
        * instantiates the constr t under the same name.

(*
    Choose a variable such that two additional hypotheses are satisfied.

    Arguments:
        * s: ident, one of the two hypotheses.
        * v: constr, the requirted constr that needs to be instantiated.
        * u: ident, the other hypothesis.

(*
    Choose a variable such that three additional hypotheses are satisfied.

    Arguments:

        * u: ident, the second hypothesis.
