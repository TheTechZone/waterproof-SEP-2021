(** * Testcases for [By ... it holds that ... : ...] *)

(** * Test 1
    Base case: intoduce a sublemma with a lemma that proves it
    immediately.
*)
Lemma test1: 0 = 0.
Proof.
    By zero_lt_one it holds that this_lemma:(0 < 1).
    assert_hyp_has_type @this_lemma constr:(0 < 1).
Abort.


(** * Test 2
    Corner case: try a sublemma that cannot be solved,
    at least not with the default lemmas and the provided lemma.
*)
Lemma test2: 0 = 0.
Proof.
    let result () := 
        By zero_lt_one it holds that this_lemma:(1 > 2)
    in
    assert_raises_error result.
Abort.

(** * Test 1
    Base case: intoduce a sublemma that can be proven immediately.
*)
Lemma test1: 0 = 0.
Proof.
    It holds that this_lemma:(True).
    assert_hyp_has_type @this_lemma constr:(True).
Abort.


(** * Test 2
    Corner case: try a sublemma that cannot be solved,
    at least not with the default lemmas [waterprove] uses.
*)
Lemma test2: 0 = 0.
Proof.
    let result () := 
        It holds that this_lemma:(1 > 2)
    in
    assert_raises_error result.
Abort.
