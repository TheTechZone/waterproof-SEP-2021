(** * type_of
    Gallina function mapping a term of a type
    to the type itself.

    Arguments:
        - [T:type], any type
        - [x:T], a term of a generic type T.
    Returns:
        - [T], the type of x.

(** * check_constr_type_equal  
    Ltac2 function: [constr -> constr -> bool].
    Check if the normalized TYPE OF [a] is syntactically 
    equal to the normalized TYPE OF [b].

    Arguments:
        - [a, b: constr], any [constr]
    Returns:
        - [bool]:
            - [true] if the TYPES OF [a] and [b] are syntactically equal
                (i.e. are of the same type after normalization)
            - [false] otherwise.
*)

    Constr.equal (eval cbv in (type_of $a)) (eval cbv in (type_of $b)).

(** * check_constr_equal
    Ltac2 function: [constr -> constr -> bool]
    Check if the normalized form of [a] is syntactically 
    equal to the normalized form of [b].

    Arguments:
        - [a, b: constr], any [constr]
    Returns:
        - [bool]:
            - [true] if a and b are syntactically equal
                (i.e. are of the same type after normalization)
            - [false] otherwise.

    Print all hypotheses of the current context as [ident : type] pairs,
    each on a separate line.
