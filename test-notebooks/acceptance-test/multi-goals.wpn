And then, if $n$ is a natural number, $S n$ is a natural number as well. Here, $S$ is called the _successor_ function. \n\nWe think of $O$ as $0$, and will from now on write $0$ instead of $O$, but it is good to realize that in first instance, it is just a symbol. We interpret $S(O)$ as $1$, and $S(S(S(S(O))))$ as $4$. From now on we will use the notation as numbers."
